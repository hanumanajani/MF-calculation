# ⚡ Magnetic Field Calculator (MF-Calculator)

The **Magnetic Field Calculator** is a Python-based tool developed to compute **magnetic fields produced by moving charges** in enzymatic systems.  
It uses charge data extracted from the **AMBER library** and velocity calculations between simulation frames.  

## 🔬 Purpose
- Investigates the role of **internal magnetic fields** in enzyme catalysis.  
- Provides insights into field strength and its possible biological relevance.  

## ⚙️ Features
- Automated calculations for multiple simulation frames.  
- Compatible with AMBER-generated charge data.  
- Outputs magnetic field values in microtesla (µT).
